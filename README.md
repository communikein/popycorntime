An automated tool to look for TV Shows episodes and download them via torrent files

## INSTALL
To be able to use this script we will have to go through 4 steps:
1. Download and install both Python 2.7 and qBittorrent
  Here are the links to both the programs you will need to install:
  * Python 2.7 - [link to download](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
  * qBittorrent - [link to download](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
2. Install the required python libraries
3. Setup qBittorrent for remote use
4. Configure the script to use qBittorrent

2. Once both the program are installed, we now need to install the python libraries used by the script.
We are going to use four different libraries:
* urllib2
* json
* BautifulSoup
* qbittorrent

To install them, simply open the command line, type the following commands and hit enter after every single one of them:
```
pip install urllib2
pip install BeautifulSoup
pip install qbittorrent
```
