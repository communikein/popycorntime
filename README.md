An automated tool to look for TV Shows episodes and download them via torrent files

A few things are necessary to run this program:
- python 2.7 - [link to download](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- qbittorrent - [link to download](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)

Once both the program are installed, we now need to install the python libraries used by the script.
We are going to use four different libraries:
- urllib2
```
pip install urllib2
```

- json

This library comes already installed with the Python 2.7 version

- BautifulSoup
```
pip install BeautifulSoup
```

- qbittorrent
```
pip install qbittorrent
```
