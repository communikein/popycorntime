An automated tool to look for TV Shows episodes and download them via torrent files

A few things are necessary to run this program:
* Python 2.7 - [link to download](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
* qBittorrent - [link to download](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)

Once both the program are installed, we now need to install the python libraries used by the script.
We are going to use four different libraries:
* urllib2
* json
* BautifulSoup
* qbittorrent

To install them, simply open the command line and type:
```
pip install urllib2
pip install BeautifulSoup
pip install qbittorrent
```

This library comes already installed with the Python 2.7 version
